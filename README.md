-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mudassar! I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at FAST-NUCES, with a focus on AI and computer vision.

-ðŸ‘€ **AI and Computer Vision Enthusiast**: My primary interest lies in AI, particularly in object detection, image processing, and real-time video analysis. I have hands-on experience using OpenCV and implementing models like YOLOv9 for real-time processing.

-ðŸŒ± **Current Focus**: Iâ€™m working on a kidney stone detection project using YOLOv10 and OpenCV, developing detection models for medical imaging to aid in faster and more accurate diagnosis. I'm also exploring deep learning applications in medical AI.

-ðŸŽ¨ **Generative Models**: I'm experimenting with GANs and Stable Diffusion, working on creative applications like image-to-sketch conversion.

-ðŸ›’ **DashGrab Project**: A cashier-less clothing store system where customers pick items and leave, with real-time billing and tracking handled by CCTV using advanced detection models.
