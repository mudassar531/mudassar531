ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mudassar! I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at FAST-NUCES, with a focus on AI and computer vision.

ðŸ‘€ AI and Computer Vision Enthusiast: My primary interest lies in AI, particularly in the fields of object detection, image processing, and real-time video analysis. I have hands-on experience using OpenCV and implementing state-of-the-art models like YOLOv9 for real-time image and video processing.

ðŸŒ± Current Focus: Iâ€™m currently working on kidney stone detection using YOLOv10 and OpenCV. This project involves developing advanced object detection models tailored for medical imaging, aiming to assist in faster and more accurate diagnosis of kidney stones. I'm also exploring applications of Deep Learning in medical AI.

ðŸŽ¨ Generative Models: In addition to object detection, Iâ€™m diving into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Stable Diffusion techniques. My current experiments include transforming images to sketches and vice versa, which blends both creativity and technical skills. This work can be used in applications ranging from image-to-sketch conversion to enhancing AI-driven creativity in visual content.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to reach out via email at molaa..531@gmail.com.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

âš¡ Fun Fact: I'm passionate about problem-solving and enjoy the strategic challenges of chess, which helps me think critically and stay sharp in both coding and life.
